🚀 Just open-sourced: Universal Codebase Optimization Framework (UCOF)

I built a tool that analyzes any codebase for security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and technical debt - using AI agents that actually save you money.

The problem with AI code review:
❌ Dumping entire codebases into ChatGPT/Claude hits context limits
❌ Using GPT-4/Opus for everything is expensive
❌ No structure = inconsistent results

UCOF solves this with:
✅ 8 specialized domain agents (security, performance, data, etc.)
✅ Smart model routing (Opus for security, Haiku for simple scans)
✅ Fresh context per task = 80% token savings
✅ Prioritized fix plan with effort estimates

One command: `ucof analyze /path/to/project`

Output:
- Health score (0-100)
- Critical issues that need immediate attention
- Phased execution plan (what to fix first)
- Systemic patterns ("your app has no error handling anywhere")

Built this after doing SOC 2 audits and seeing the same issues across dozens of codebases. Now it's automated.

I automated my job as a code auditor 🤖

After reviewing dozens of codebases for security and performance issues, I noticed:
→ Same problems appear everywhere
→ Manual review takes days
→ Developers miss issues until production breaks

So I built UCOF - an AI-powered codebase analyzer that:

📊 Scans your entire project in minutes
🔒 Finds security vulnerabilities before hackers do
⚡ Identifies performance bottlenecks
📋 Creates a prioritized fix list

The smart part? It uses cheap AI models for simple tasks and expensive ones only when needed. Saves 80% on AI costs vs. throwing everything at GPT-4.

One command. Full report. Clear action plan.

## Option C: Story-Driven

"Your app has zero tests and the status endpoint leaks user data."

That's what my AI found in 3 minutes. A manual audit would've taken 2 days.

I've been doing SOC 2 compliance audits at EY, reviewing codebases for security issues. The work is important but repetitive.

Same patterns. Same mistakes. Same fixes.

So I built an AI system that does the first pass automatically:

→ Security vulnerabilities
→ Database query problems (N+1 queries killing performance)
→ Missing error handling
→ Infrastructure gaps

The trick: Don't use one expensive AI for everything.

My system routes tasks to the right model:
• Security analysis → Opus (smartest, most expensive)
• Simple file scanning → Haiku (fast, cheap)
• Standard review → Sonnet (balanced)

Result: 80% cost savings, consistent quality.

Now it's open source. Use it on your projects.
