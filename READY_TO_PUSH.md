## 🚀 What's New in v2.0

### Enhanced Skill Version

**Before:**
- Single-model analysis (Haiku only)
- Sequential domain processing
- 10+ minute analysis time
- Basic reporting

**After:**
- ✅ **Parallel analysis** (3-5 min total)
- ✅ **Model optimization** (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus routing)
- ✅ **Systemic pattern detection**
- ✅ **Phased execution roadmap**

### Execution Flow

```
Discovery (30s) → Parallel Batch 1 (60s) → Parallel Batch 2 (60s) → Parallel Batch 3 (60s) → Synthesis (60s) → Report
   Haiku              Opus                    Sonnet                  Sonnet                Opus

Total: 3-5 minutes
```

## 🎯 User Experience

### For Developers (Skill Version)

**Old way:**
```
Read skill → Wait 10 minutes → Get basic findings
```

**New way:**
```
Read https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nativardi/ucof/main/SKILL.md
→ Parallel analysis across 8 domains (3-5 min)
→ Systemic pattern detection
→ Phased execution plan
→ Ready to fix immediately
```

### For Teams (CLI Version)

**Unchanged** - Still the same powerful automation with parallel domains and model routing.

## 📋 What Users Will See

### Landing on README.md

```
🚀 Quick Decision Guide
├─ Path A: Skill (free, 3-5 min, no API key)
└─ Path B: CLI (automation, 1-3 min, ~$0.50)

Both versions:
✅ Parallel analysis
✅ Model optimization (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus)
✅ 8 domains (Security, Data, Backend, External, Frontend, Infrastructure, Performance, Quality)
✅ Systemic pattern detection
✅ Phased execution roadmap
```

### Using the Skill

```
In Claude Code:
Read https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nativardi/ucof/main/SKILL.md
Then analyze /path/to/my/project

Results in 3-5 minutes:
- Health Score: XX/100
- Top 5 issues to fix (prioritized)
- Systemic patterns detected
- Phase 0-3 execution roadmap
```
